            About the project
        </h1>
        <p>
            This project has been developed by a group of five Computer Science students at Aalborg University. This is a 2nd Semester Project.
            <br><br>
            WattsApp is an energy saving network bot that helps stabilizing the energy grid through the adjustment of connected devices.
            The red graph displayed on the front page shows the current simulated production of renewable energy. When the red graph is above zero, there is an RE surplus, and when it is below 0, there is an RE deficit.
            Therefore, WattsApp helps schedule devices to turn on when there is surplus, so that they can be turned off when there is no surplus without having to use energy during the deficit period. The blue graph shows the energy used by the current connected devices.
            <br><br>
            The first version of WattsApp includes one device: The water heater.
            <br><br>
            Further development of the program looks to include multiple devices, the first new device added being the washing machine.
